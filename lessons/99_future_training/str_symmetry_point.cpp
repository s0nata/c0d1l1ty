 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 *   int solution(const string &S); 
 *
 * that, given a string S, returns the index (counting from 0) of a
 * character such that the part of the string to the left of that
 * character is a reversal of the part of the string to its right. The
 * function should return âˆ’1 if no such index exists.
 *
 * Note: reversing an empty string (i.e. a string whose length is zero)
 * gives an empty string.
 *
 * For example, given a string:
 *
 * "racecar"
 *
 * the function should return 3, because the substring to the left of
 * the character "e" at index 3 is "rac", and the one to the right is
 * "car".
 *
 * Given a string:
 *
 * "x"
 *
 * the function should return 0, because both substrings are empty.
 *
 * Assume that:
 *
 *       the length of S is within the range [0..2,000,000].
 *
 * Complexity:
 *
 *       expected worst-case time complexity is O(length(S));
 *       expected worst-case space complexity is O(1) (not counting the
 *         storage required for input arguments).
