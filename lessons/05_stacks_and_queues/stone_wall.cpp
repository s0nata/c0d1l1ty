 * Result: not solved yet
 *
 * Solution to this task can be found at our blog.
 *
 * You are going to build a stone wall. The wall should be straight and
 * N meters long, and its thickness should be constant; however, it
 * should have different heights in different places. The height of the
 * wall is specified by a zero-indexed array H of N positive
 * integers. H[I] is the height of the wall from I to I+1 meters to the
 * right of its left end. In particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's
 * left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.
 *
 * The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides
 * of such blocks are rectangular). Your task is to compute the minimum
 * number of blocks needed to build the wall.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 *   int solution(const vector<int> &H);
 *
 * that, given a zero-indexed array H of N positive integers specifying
 * the height of the wall, returns the minimum number of blocks needed
 * to build it.
 *
 * For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
 *
 * H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
 * H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
 * H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
 *
 * the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible
 * arrangement of seven blocks.
 *
 * Assume that:
 *
 *       N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
 *       each element of array H is an integer within the range
 *         [1..1,000,000,000].
 *
 * Complexity:
 *
 *       expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
 *       expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input
 *         storage (not counting the storage required for input
 *         arguments).
 *
 *Elements of input arrays can be modified.
