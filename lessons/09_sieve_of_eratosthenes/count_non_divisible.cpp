 * 
 * You are given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N
 * integers.
 *
 * For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number
 * of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say
 * that these elements are non-divisors.
 *
 * For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:
 *
 *   A[0] = 3
 *   A[1] = 1
 *   A[2] = 2
 *   A[3] = 3
 *   A[4] = 6
 *
 * For the following elements:
 *
 *       A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
 *       A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
 *       A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
 *       A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
 *       A[6] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
 *
 * Write a function:
 *
 *   vector<int> solution(vector<int> &A); 
 *
 * that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N
 * integers, returns a sequence of integers representing the amount of
 * non-divisors.
 *
 * The sequence should be returned as:
 *
 *       a structure Results (in C), or
 *       a vector of integers (in C++), or
 *       a record Results (in Pascal), or
 *       an array of integers (in any other programming language).
 *
 * For example, given:
 *
 *   A[0] = 3
 *   A[1] = 1
 *   A[2] = 2
 *   A[3] = 3
 *   A[4] = 6
 *
 * the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.
 *
 * Assume that:
 *
 *       N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
 *       each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2*N].
 *
 * Complexity:
 *
 *       expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
 *       expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input
 *         storage (not counting the storage required for input
 *         arguments).
 *
 * Elements of input arrays can be modified.
